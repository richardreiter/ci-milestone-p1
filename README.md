# Vinyl Exchange Club

[Vinyl Exchange Club](https://richardreiter.github.io/vinyl-exchange-club/) is a website dedicated to LP aficionados, who are looking into engaging with other vinyl collectors. The website will be targeted at people who own vinyl records, so these like-minded people can meet, explore new music, genres, artists and bands - all in a sustainable way - swapping their record collection among each other during events/meetups.
